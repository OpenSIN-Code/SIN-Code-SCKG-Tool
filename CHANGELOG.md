- **GraphQL Subscriptions** — `graph_updated`, `node_changed`, `hot_paths_changed` for real-time dashboards
- Repo field on Node/Edge types for multi-repo filtering
- Incremental graph updates: `remove_nodes_by_file`, `upsert_file`, `filter_by_repo`, `get_cross_repo_edges`, `get_repos`
- Circular repository dependency detection
- 13 new tests (watcher: 5, similarity: 5, ADR: 3) — 77 total tests, 100% passing

### Changed
- `KnowledgeGraph` extended with repo support and incremental update methods

### Fixed
- N/A (all additions, no breaking changes)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-06 — Hot-paths, N-gram search, GraphQL API

### Added
- **Hot-paths detection** (`sckg hot-paths` CLI) — ranks functions by centrality (in/out degree, betweenness, PageRank)
- Hot-path visualization: gold border + glow + size-scaled nodes in D3.js graph
- **N-gram semantic search** (`sckg search` CLI) — BM25-ranked fuzzy search over names, docstrings, params, calls
- Search panel in HTML: real-time results, click to center node
- Pattern search: `sckg search --pattern "handle_*"` for wildcard matching
- **GraphQL API server** (`sckg serve` CLI) — FastAPI + Strawberry GraphQL with GraphiQL playground
- GraphQL schema: nodes, edges, communities, hot_paths, dead_code, search, stats queries
- `sckg graphql-schema` CLI — prints SDL for codegen
- REST endpoints: `/health`, `/schema`, `/stats`
- 16 new tests (hotpaths: 5, search: 5, API: 6) — 64 total tests, 100% passing

### Changed
- `html_generator.py` extended with hot-path styling, search UI panel, GraphQL playground link
- `cli.py` added `search`, `serve`, `graphql-schema` commands
- `graph` command now includes hot-path data in HTML output
- Dependencies: added `strawberry-graphql`, `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `httpx`, `pytest-asyncio`

### Fixed

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-06 — Cross-repo edges, dead-code detection, language-aware communities

### Added
- Cross-repo edge detection — finds `subprocess` / `os.system` calls and cross-repo imports between repositories
- `sckg cross-repo` CLI command + `sckg index --workspace` for multi-repo indexing
- Cross-repo edges visualized as purple dashed lines in D3.js graph (`#9C27B0`, `stroke-dasharray: 5,5`)
- Dead-code detection — flags nodes with 0 incoming edges (excluding entry points: `main`, `__init__`, CLI handlers, exports)
- `sckg dead-code` CLI command with `--threshold` for CI integration (exit code 1 if coverage < threshold)
- Dead / suspicious / entry-point visual markers in graph (red border, yellow border, green border)
- Language-aware community detection — clusters by language first, then by code relationships within each language
- `sckg communities` CLI command with `--by-language` (default) and `--mixed` flags
- Mixed-language communities detected (e.g., Python calling Go via subprocess) — purple background in graph
- Community bounding boxes and labels in D3.js visualization with language-colored backgrounds
- `Community` dataclass with dominant language, language breakdown, size, and density metrics
- `DeadCodeReport` dataclass with dead nodes, entry points, suspicious nodes, coverage percentage
- `find_repos_in_workspace()` utility for auto-discovering repositories in a directory
- 17 new tests (cross-repo: 7, dead-code: 5, communities: 5) — 48 total tests, 100% passing

### Changed
- `html_generator.py` now supports multiple edge styles (solid, dashed) and node border colors (red/yellow/green)
- Graph legend expanded to show edge types and node state categories
- `graph.py` extended with `detect_communities_by_language()` and `get_communities()` methods
- Community detection algorithm enhanced with language-aware clustering (primary: language, secondary: code relationships)

### Fixed
- N/A (all additions, no breaking changes)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-06 — Multi-language support: Go + TypeScript

### Added
- Go parser (tree-sitter-go) — indexes functions, structs, methods, imports, calls
- TypeScript/TSX parser (tree-sitter-typescript) — indexes functions, classes, imports, JSX components
- Multi-language dispatcher (`parsers/` package) — auto-detects language from file extension
- Language-color coding in graph visualization — Python (blue), Go (cyan), TypeScript (orange)
- Graph legend showing language → color mapping
- Language filtering in query results (optional)

### Changed
- `parser.py` refactored to dispatcher pattern (`parsers/` package)
- Graph nodes now include `language` field
- HTML output uses D3.js color coding per language

### Fixed
